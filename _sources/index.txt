Master Person Index (MPI) Business Profiler
==============================================

Introduction
------------

Enterprise Master Persin Index (EMPI) is being used to provide a service to requesting sites for their enrollees.
Enrollees are employees of that site that are enrolled in a health insurance plan with a service provider. The
input contains serialized partial demographic information of enrollees. This service augments the enrollee information
with a Medical Record Number (MRN) so that the site can link the medical information with the enrollee.

Refer `MPI-Pilot charter <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HjNgKmlERUIrP3DqpfY3rW4xiJlX4d1ZnQVYZp2MfHE/edit#heading=h.c7g9to16w1a2>`_
